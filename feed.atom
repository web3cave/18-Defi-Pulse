The algorithm that controls $UST is decentralized, but the $BTC reserve “in case something goes wrong” is controlled by an entity.
Because of recent volatility, they've announced a $1.5B deployment. https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1523532476898897920]]></summary>

Maker's vaults are controlled by smart-contracts. The collateral management, liquidation process, price checks, everything is decentralized. Emergency processes can be triggered by the DAO, a decentralized entity.

Each $DAI in circulation is backed by a diverse class of cryptoassets. If your vault collateralization drops from a certain amount (from 130 to 150%) you're liquidated.
